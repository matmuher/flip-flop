## MA_LANGUAGE

In this project i developed a tiny programming language.
To be exact i:
### 1. Developed language's grammar (will be added later, but you can try to get it by exploring [great_grammar](great_grammar.cpp)).

### 2. Created frontend for this language. I made RDP (recursive descent parser). As a result i got AST (abstract syntax tree)

### 3.Created backend that translates AST to assembler of my [processor](https://github.com/matmuher/flip-flop/tree/main/processor)
